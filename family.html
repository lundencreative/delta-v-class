      <p>
        Clint is my boyfriend of three years.  He has four children, ages 4 through 15.  He's really loud, but I'm pretty sure it's because he's got some undiagnosed hearing loss.  Or, that's what I tell people if they ask.

      <p>
        Noah is 15 and he is your typical teenage boy.  He loves football, anything related to Fornite, and acting as though anything we ask him to do is the most exasperating thing on the face of the planet.
