      <p>
        Clint is my boyfriend of three years.  He has four children, ages 4 through 15.  He's really loud... like ZERO volume control. I used to think he was just that excited about everything, but then I realized he doesn't know he's always the loudest person in the room. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

      <p>
        Noah is 15 and he is your typical teenage boy.  He loves football, anything related to Fornite, and acting as though anything we ask him to do is the most exasperating thing on the face of the planet.
