        I've been employed with P&G in Iowa City since 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current title is Supplier Quality Leader.  In this role, I work as the SPOC (single point of contact) between the production lines and the plant's material suppliers.  I facilitate loss elimination teams within the plant to drive out losses that the lines thought were related to material quality.  I also help suppliers drive out loss through their company's root cause analysis tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explained poorly, people complain at me about materials, I pick a person to side with, and then complain at the other until they fix the problem.
